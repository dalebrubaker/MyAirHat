## Notes for Implementation

This outline represents a comprehensive technical package. For initial production, focus on:
1. Sections 2-4 (BOM, Patterns, Manufacturing)
2. Section 5.1-5.2 (Basic Quality Control)
3. Section 6.1 (Individual Packaging)

Additional sections can be developed as production scales up and more formal manufacturing partnerships are established.
